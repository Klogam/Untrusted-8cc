# Untrusted-8cc
A very simple demonstration of an untrusted compiler described in Ken Thompson's paper. http://vxer.org/lib/pdf/Reflections%20on%20Trusting%20Trust.pdf

This demonstrates how you could compromise a compiler to do your wishes. Although it is hard to switch someone's compiler,
imagine if you are Kaspersky and you want to prove your source code is clean and free of malicious code. Nobody will
bother to check the compiler.

How to use:
Retrieve the 8cc compiler from here https://github.com/rui314/8cc

Replace main.c with the main.c located here, then follow instructions from the 8cc compiler to compile and run.
